1.  What is the primary objective of a retriever in a RAG system, and what makes this task challenging?
2.  Describe how metadata filtering works within a retriever system, and provide one key advantage and one significant limitation of this technique.
3.  Explain the "bag of words" concept as it applies to keyword search. What is its main implication for how keyword search processes text?
4.  Briefly differentiate between Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Best Matching 25 (BM25) in keyword search.
5.  How does an embedding model enable semantic search to understand the meaning of text, and what property do the resulting vectors have?
6.  Compare and contrast Euclidean distance and cosine similarity as measures for vector proximity in semantic search.
7.  What is contrastive training, and how does it help an embedding model learn to map similar texts to nearby locations in vector space?
8.  Outline the main steps of a hybrid search pipeline from the moment a prompt is received until the final documents are returned.
9.  Define Precision and Recall in the context of retriever evaluation. Explain how they can often present a trade-off.
10. What does Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) measure, and why is it particularly useful for evaluating a retriever's performance?
